# Hey, I’m sprudello

I make stuff. Sometimes it’s helpful. Sometimes it's not. And sometimes it breaks my whole system :)

## 🧠 What I care about

- Making tools that are actually useful (hopefully)
- Building stuff that makes life easier (for others or just for me)
- Understanding how things work, even if it’s the hard way
- Projects that start as a joke and end up weirdly functional

## 🔨 What I’ve done (or broken)

- An infrastructure website to play tag like in "JetLag: TheGame" and self-host it.
- A work-time calculator because of weird german wage-regulations
- A blackjack AI that tries its best
- A rock-paper-scissors AI made with a vision model and some cursed finetuning
- A brain tumor classifier made with just math and desperation
- A personal task app to remind myself to be a functioning human
- A home server that runs radio, cloud, and chaos


## ⚒️ What I’m messing with now

- A goblin-tier shopping list + inventory app
- Dumb little tools for daily chaos
- Projects that make me say “wait... this could actually help someone”

> Not here to be perfect. Just here to build weird little things that might help someone live easier. Maybe that someone is me.

If you also wake up at 4am wondering if you remembered to drink water—hi.
